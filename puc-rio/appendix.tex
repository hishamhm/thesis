\chaptermark{Spreadsheet interpreter}

We present here a demonstration of the spreadsheet interpreter in
use. This appendix is a Literate Haskell program including the complete
source code of the demonstration.

This program imports the interpreter defined in Chapter \ref{chap:Spreadsheets}
as a module, as well as some standard modules from the Haskell Platform.
We also use one additional module for tabular pretty-printing of the
output: \texttt{Text.PrettyPrint.Boxes}, available from Hackage, the
Haskell community's package repository\footnote{\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/boxes}}.

\chapter{Demonstration of the interpreter modeling LabVIEW\label{appendix:LabVIEW}}

\chaptermark{LabVIEW interpreter}

We present here a demonstration of the interpreter modeling LabVIEW.
We produced several examples, which are available at $ $\url{https://hisham.hm/thesis/},
along with the resulting outputs of their execution. Here, we present
only one of them. This is the test for the ``case'' structure, represented
in LabVIEW this way:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{labview_appendix_example}
\par\end{center}

Through the process explained in Section \ref{subsec:LabVIEW-Demonstration},
our interpreter produces a visualization of the execution. This is
a frame of the resulting animation, just before performing the division:

\noindent The test program for this example is the following.
