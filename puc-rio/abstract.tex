Many applications are made programmable for advanced end-users by
adding facilities such as scripting and macros. Other applications
take a programming language to the center stage of its UI. That is
the case, for example, of the spreadsheet formula language. While
scripting has benefited from the advances of programming language
research, producing mature and reusable languages, the state of UI-level
languages lags behind. We claim that a better understanding of such
languages is necessary. In this work, we model the semantics of existing
end-user programming languages in three different domains: multimedia,
spreadsheets and engineering. Our focus is on dataflow languages,
a representative paradigm for end-user programmable applications.
Based on this analysis, we aim to provide a better understanding of
dataflow semantics as used in the context of end-user programming
and propose guidelines for the design of UI-level languages for end-user
programmable applications.
